# E-Commerce Product Management System

## üìå Overview
This project is a **C++ console-based e-commerce simulation** that demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
It allows creation of products, management of shopping carts, applying discounts, and placing/canceling orders.  

The project was developed as part of coursework to illustrate:
- **Inheritance**
- **Interfaces (abstract classes)**
- **Operator overloading**
- **Template classes**
- **Polymorphism and virtual functions**
