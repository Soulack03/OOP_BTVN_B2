# Circle Class Example

This project demonstrates a simple C++ class named `Circle` that models a circle with a radius and color. The class provides methods for user input, calculating circumference and area, and displaying circle properties.

## Features

- Input validation for radius (must be non-negative)
- Input color of the circle
- Calculate circumference and area
- Display circle's radius, color, circumference, and area

## File Structure

- `circle.cpp` â€” Main source file containing the `Circle` class and a demonstration in `main()`.

## Build Instructions

Open a terminal in the project directory and compile with:

```sh
g++ -o circle circle.cpp
```

## Run Instructions

After building, run the program:

```sh
./circle
```

On Windows, use:

```sh
circle.exe
```

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC)

# Person Class Example

This project demonstrates a simple C++ class named `Person` that stores and manages basic information about a person, such as name, age, address, and phone number. The class provides methods to display information, update the address, check adulthood, and print a greeting.

## Files

- `person.cpp`: Main source file containing the `Person` class and a sample usage in `main()`.

## Build Instructions

To compile the program, use a C++ compiler such as `g++`. Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```sh
g++ -o person person.cpp
```

## Run Instructions

After building, run the executable:

```sh
./person
```

On Windows, use:

```sh
person.exe
```

## Requirements

- C++12 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC)
